Objective:

There are sales figures based on TV, Radio and Newspaper advertisements.

From here Sales Column is the target i.e. y=df['Sales'].

You will be looking for an answer to the question of how much my sales figures will increase if I invest separately in TV, radio and newspaper.

You will find out which advertising method is more successful.

You will visualize the data you allocated as testing and the data you predicted in the same graph with a line chart.
